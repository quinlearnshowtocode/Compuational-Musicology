Corpus of choice: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWXbttAJcbphz?si=b6bb55c48eb246ad

The playlist I've put together is a collection of 2010s R&B tunes generated by Spotify. I've gone with this particular corpus for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I'm a bit of a fan of the 2010s R&B genre, it's what I tend to have a listen to the most and have the most knowledge in. Secondly, this playlist is a very popular one, officially generated by Spotify. The mechanism that Spotify uses to generate playlists is known for being effective in uncovering new and exciting tunes. However, There's a bit of a myth floating around about whether these playlists are made by humans or algorithms, based on what metrics, and whether commercial interests or money play a role. Therefore, a further analysis on this playlist would be helpful for uncovering the mechanisms of Spotify's official playlist. Lastly, as an official playlist with many followers, this corpus shoulbe be comprehensive enough to represent 2010s RnB, however, in the analysis we will find out whether this is representative enough.

The groups that I would like to compare in this corpus is the sub-genres, although they are all categorized as R&B, I recognized that some tracks are more pop R&B while some are Hip pop R&B, some has neo-soul influence etc. By skimming through this playlist, I noticed that there are a good reprensentative number of 2010s R&B artists, however, the tunes that are included in this playlist are not always the most popular or "R&B" ones, some are quite niche songs. For example, there is this song called "Too Much" by Sampha. Although Sampha is known for his alternative R&B/ soul genre, "Too Much" is not strictly an R&B song and it's not popular to the point of being essential and representative to 2010s Rnb as the objective of this playlist.
