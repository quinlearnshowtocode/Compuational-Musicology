The playlist I've put together is a collection of 2010s R&B tunes generated by Spotify. I've gone with this particular corpus for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I'm a bit of a fan of the 2010s R&B genre, it's what I tend to have a listen to the most and have the most knowledge in. Secondly, this playlist is a very popular one, officially generated by Spotify. The mechanism that Spotify uses to generate playlists is known for being effective in uncovering new and exciting tunes. However, There's a bit of a myth floating around about whether these playlists are made by humans or algorithms, and whether commercial interests or money play a role. Therefore, a further analysis on this playlist would be helpful for uncovering the mechanisms of Spotify's official playlist.
