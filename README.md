# Compuational-Musicology

Corpus of choice: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWXbttAJcbphz?si=b6bb55c48eb246ad
It is a playlist of 2010s R&B music generated by Spotify. The reason why I chose this corpus is because 1) 2010s R&B is the genre that I listen to the most, 2) it is a very popular playlist and it is generated officially by Spotify, whose mechanism for generating playlist is fruitful for being discovered. Whether the playlists are made by labour or algorithms is a myth.
